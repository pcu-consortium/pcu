About PCU :

The [PCU Consortium](http://pcu-consortium.github.io/) aims at building an Open Source, unified Machine Learning (ML) platform targeted at business applications such as ecommerce,
that makes search a first-class citizen of Big Data.
The [PCU platform](https://github.com/pcu-consortium/pcu) is built on best-of-breed Open Source components : ElasticSearch, Spark, Kafka, Java (Apache CXF, Jackson, Spring Boot).
It is bundled with a default application : the PCU Entreprise Search engine.
